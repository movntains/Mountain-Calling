# Mountain Calling

This is my take on the YelpCamp project from Colt Steele's [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course. Like YelpCamp, it was made with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and RESTful routes. However, I used Sass, Flexbox, and CSS Grid instead of Bootstrap, as well as Pug in lieu of EJS. Additionally, the responsive navbar was made with custom JavaScript instead of Bootstrap JavaScript and jQuery.
